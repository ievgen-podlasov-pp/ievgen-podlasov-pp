# First-level heading
## Second-level heading
... Can be up to 6th level
###### Sixth-level heading

When we have 2 or more headings, GitHub automatically generates table of contents

**This is bold text**

* *This is italic text* *
* 
  ~~This is strikethrough text~~
  
  **This is bold and _nested italic_**
  
  ***This is all bold and italic***
  
  This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text
  
  This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text

  Text that is not a quote
  
> Text that is a quote

We can use backticks to quote code without formatting (for inline code quotes)

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

To format code or text into a quote block, use triple backticks

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
We can also use backticks to visualize colors like `#ffffff` for white or `#000000` for black
Supported formats are: 
hex (#RRGGBB, for example `#0969DA`)
rgb (rgb(R,G,B), for example `rgb(9, 105, 218)`)
hsl (hsl(H,S,L), for example `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`)
(this only works in issues, pull requests and discussions, but not in readme)
